# Three Tier SAP S/4HANA Stack Deployment using Terraform and Ansible integration

## Description
This automation solution is designed for the deployment of **Three Tier SAP S/4HANA Stack** using IBM Cloud Schematics or CLI. The SAP solution will be deployed on top of one of the following Operating Systems: **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP** in an existing IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC, using an existing [bastion host with secure remote SSH access](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bastion-setup).

The solution is based on Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks executed by Schematics and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

**It contains:**
- Terraform scripts for the deployment of two VSIs, in an EXISTING VPC, with Subnet and Security Group. The VSIs are intended to be used: one for the data base instance and the other for the application instance. The automation has support for the following versions: Terraform >= 1.5.7 and IBM Cloud provider for Terraform >= 1.57.0.  Note: The deployment was tested with Terraform 1.5.7
- Bash scripts used for the checking of the prerequisites required by SAP VSIs deployment and for the integration into a single step in IBM Schematics GUI of the VSI provisioning and the **SAP S/4HANA Stack** installation.
- Ansible scripts to configure Three Tier SAP S/4HANA primary application server and a HANA 2.0 node.
Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.


In order to track the events specific to the resources deployed by this solution, the [IBM Cloud Activity Tracker](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started#gs_ov) to be used should be specified.   
IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service collects and stores audit records for API calls made to resources that run in the IBM Cloud. It can be used to monitor the activity of your IBM Cloud account, investigate abnormal activity and critical actions, and comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted on actions as they happen.

## 1.1 Installation media
SAP HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP HANA, platform edition 2.0 SPS05** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

SAP S/4HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP S/4HANA 2.0** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## 1.2 VSI Configuration
The VSIs are deployed with one of the following Operating Systems for DB server: **Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP HANA (amd64), Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP HANA (amd6), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP HANA (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64)** and with one of the following Operating Systems for APP server: **Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP4 for SAP Applications (amd64), Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP3 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP Applications (amd64)**. The SSH keys are configured to allow root user access. The following storage volumes are creating during the provisioning:

HANA DB VSI Disks:
- the disk sizes depend on the selected profile, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc) - Updated on 2023-03-08

Note: LVM will be used for **`/hana/data`**, **`hana/log`**, **`/hana/shared`** and **`/usr/sap`**, for all storage profiles, excepting **`vx2d-44x616`** and **`vx2d-88x1232`** profiles, where **`/hana/data`** and **`/hana/shared`** won't be manged by LVM, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc#vx2d-16x224) - Updated on 2023-03-08 and to [Storage design considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-storage-design-considerations#hana-iaas-mx2-16x128-32x256-configure) - Updated on 2022-05-19

For example, in case of deploying a HANA VM, using the default value for VSI profile `mx2-16x128`, the automation will execute the following storage setup:  
- 3 volumes x 500 GB each for `<sid>_hana_vg` volume group
  - the volume group will contain the following logical volumes (created with three stripes):
    - `<sid>_hana_data_lv` - size 988 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_log_lv` - size 256 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_shared` - size 256 GB
- 1 volume x 50 GB for `/usr/sap` (volume group: `<sid>_usr_sap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_usr_sap_lv`)
- 1 volume x 10 GB for a 2 GB SWAP logical volume (volume group: `<sid>_swap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_swap_lv`)

SAP APPs VSI Disks:
- 1x 40 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

In order to perform the deployment you can use either the CLI component or the GUI component (Schematics) of the automation solution.

## 1.3 VPC Configuration

The Security Rules inherited from BASTION deployment are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group for private networks.
- Allow outbound traffic  (ALL for port 53, TCP for ports 80, 443, 8443)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.

## 1.4 Files description and structure
