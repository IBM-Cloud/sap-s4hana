## 1.1 Installation media
SAP HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP HANA, platform edition 2.0 SPS05** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

SAP S/4HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP S/4HANA 2.0** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## 1.2 VSI Configuration
The VSIs are deployed with one of the following Operating Systems for DB server: **Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP HANA (amd64), Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP HANA (amd6), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP HANA (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64)** and with one of the following Operating Systems for APP server: **Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP4 for SAP Applications (amd64), Suse Enterprise Linux 15 SP3 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP Applications (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP Applications (amd64)**. The SSH keys are configured to allow root user access. The following storage volumes are creating during the provisioning:

HANA DB VSI Disks:
- the disk sizes depend on the selected profile, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc) - Updated on 2023-03-08

Note: LVM will be used for **`/hana/data`**, **`hana/log`**, **`/hana/shared`** and **`/usr/sap`**, for all storage profiles, excepting **`vx2d-44x616`** and **`vx2d-88x1232`** profiles, where **`/hana/data`** and **`/hana/shared`** won't be manged by LVM, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc#vx2d-16x224) - Updated on 2023-03-08 and to [Storage design considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-storage-design-considerations#hana-iaas-mx2-16x128-32x256-configure) - Updated on 2022-05-19

For example, in case of deploying a HANA VM, using the default value for VSI profile `mx2-16x128`, the automation will execute the following storage setup:  
- 3 volumes x 500 GB each for `<sid>_hana_vg` volume group
  - the volume group will contain the following logical volumes (created with three stripes):
    - `<sid>_hana_data_lv` - size 988 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_log_lv` - size 256 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_shared` - size 256 GB
- 1 volume x 50 GB for `/usr/sap` (volume group: `<sid>_usr_sap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_usr_sap_lv`)
- 1 volume x 10 GB for a 2 GB SWAP logical volume (volume group: `<sid>_swap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_swap_lv`)

SAP APPs VSI Disks:
- 1x 40 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

In order to perform the deployment you can use either the CLI component or the GUI component (Schematics) of the automation solution.

## 1.3 VPC Configuration

The Security Rules inherited from BASTION deployment are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group for private networks.
- Allow outbound traffic  (ALL for port 53, TCP for ports 80, 443, 8443)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.

## 1.4 Files description and structure

The solution is based on Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks executed by Schematics and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules.
 - `ansible`  - directory containing the SAP ansible playbooks.
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for the deployment of the current SAP solution.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (VPC, Hostname, Private IP).
 - `integration*.tf & generate*.tf` files - contain the integration code that makes the SAP variabiles from Terraform available to Ansible.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI.
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
 - `sch.auto.tfvars` - contains programatic variables.

    1.  From the IBM Cloud menu
    select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).
       - Click Create a workspace.
       - Enter a name for your workspace.
       - Click Create to create your workspace.
    2.  On the workspace **Settings** page, enter the URL of this solution in the Schematics examples Github repository.
     - Select the latest Terraform version.
     - Click **Save template information**.
     - In the **Input variables** section, review the default input variables and provide alternatives if desired.
    - Click **Save changes**.

4.  From the workspace **Settings** page, click **Generate plan** 
5.  Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform
    execution plan.
6.  Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
7.  Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the
    provisioning, modification, or deletion process.

The output of the Schematics Apply Plan will list the public/private IP addresses
of the VSI host, the hostname and the VPC.
