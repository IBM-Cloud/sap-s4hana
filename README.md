- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.


 ## Files description and structure:

 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for the deployment of the current SAP solution.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP)
 - `integration*.tf` - contains the integration code that makes the SAP variabiles from Terraform available to Ansible.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `terraform.tfvars` - contains the IBM Cloud API key referenced in `provider.tf` (dynamically generated)
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.


## Steps to follow:

1.  Make sure that you have the [required IBM Cloud IAM
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to
    create and work with VPC infrastructure and you are [assigned the
    correct
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to
    create the workspace in Schematics and deploy resources.
2.  [Generate an SSH
    key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).
    The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server
    instances via the bastion host. After you have created your SSH key,
    make sure to [upload this SSH key to your IBM Cloud
    account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in
    the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy the SAP solution
3.  Create the Schematics workspace:
    1.  From the IBM Cloud menu
    select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).
       - Click Create a workspace.   
       - Enter a name for your workspace.   
       - Click Create to create your workspace.
    2.  On the workspace **Settings** page, enter the URL of this solution in the Schematics examples Github repository.
     - Select the latest Terraform version.
     - Click **Save template information**.
     - In the **Input variables** section, review the default input variables and provide alternatives if desired.
    - Click **Save changes**.

4.  From the workspace **Settings** page, click **Generate plan** 
5.  Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform
    execution plan.
6.  Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
7.  Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the
    provisioning, modification, or deletion process.

The output of the Schematics Apply Plan will list the public/private IP addresses
of the VSI host, the hostname and the VPC.

**Obs***: <br />
- Sensitive - The variable value is not displayed in your tf files details after terrafrorm plan&apply commands.<br />
- The following variables should be the same like the bastion ones: REGION, ZONE, VPC, SUBNET, SECURITY_GROUP.

## VPC Configuration

The Security Rules are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group
- Allow all outbound traffic
- Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)
- Option to Allow inbound TCP traffic with a custom port or a range of ports.


## Files description and structure:
 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `input.auto.tfvars` - contains the variables that will need to be edited by the user to customize the solution
 - `integration-*.tf` - contains the integration code that brings the SAP variabiles from Terraform to Ansible.
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)


## Steps to follow:

For initializing terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

For planning phase:

```shell
terraform plan --out plan1
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables: 'ibmcloud_api_key', 'sap_main_password' and 'hana_main_password'.
```

For apply phase:

```shell
terraform apply "plan1"
```

For destroy:

```shell
terraform destroy
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables as a destroy confirmation phase: 'ibmcloud_api_key', 'sap_main_password' and 'hana_main_password'.
```
